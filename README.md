My take on a tiny modern USB to UART converter.
![Most Recent Version (2)](/images/Version2Board.jpeg)

This one works like any other, but here are the specs anyways:

Board Size: 23.8x13.7x1.6mm
Soldered module size: 31.7x13.7x6.4mm
Connectors: USB-C to male 2.54mm dupont headers
Max current supply: 1A at 3.3V with voltage regualtor (often limited by USB supply)
